## Imports ##

# Imports of various modules go at the top of a Python program.
# Importing a module does not result in any output.
import random

# Now you can write something like random.choice(["heads", "tails"])
# Like shorter names?
import random as rnd

# Now you can write something like rnd.choice(["heads", "tails"])
# Just want one function from a module?
from random import choice

# Now you can write: choice(["heads", "tails"])
# You can read more about modules at:

## Functions and Strings ##
###########################
def greet(greeting):
    return greeting + ", World!"


# Now you can write greet("Hello")
# Note that strings can be designated using single or double quotes
def greet(greeting="Hello"):
    return greeting + ", World!"


# Now you can write greet() and it will begin with "Hello" by default
# because of the default argument named above
def greet(greeting="Hello", audience="World"):
    return f"{greeting}, {audience}!"


# f-strings are a syntactic convenience, and highly addictive.
# prefixing your string with f allows you to interpolate defined
# variables, denoted by curly braces.
# Note the multiple defined arguments in the function. You can
# name your arguments when calling the function. For instance,
# you can write greet(audience="Galaxy")

## Variable types ##
####################
# Python has many "types"
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html
a_number = 12
another_number = 7.1
a_string = "Some text"
another_string = "Some more text"
a_range = range(10)  # the numbers 0-9, in order
a_list = ["Some text", 14, another_number, "çš„", 1]

# Dictionaries (dicts) are a crucial part of Python
a_dict = {"a_key": "a_value", "first_name": "Sheila", "pi": 3.14159}

# Use this syntax to get the value of a specific key in a dict
archimedes_constant = a_dict["pi"]

# Lists, on the other hand, can be accessed by zero-based numeric index
a_lonely_number = a_list[4]

###########
## Loops ##
###########
# Use range in a loop to count; or supply an iterable
# such as a list to walk through.
def list_random_numbers(quantity, maximum=10):
    for i in range(quantity):
        print(random.randint(0, maximum))


##################
## Conditionals ##
##  (if/then)   ##
##################
# Python has conditionals (if/then)
def compare(a, b):
    if a == b:
        print("equality")
    if not a == b:
        print("inequality")
    if a > b:
        print("greater than")
    else:
        print("less than or equal")
