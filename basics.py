# Imports of various modules go at the top of a Python program.
# Importing a module does not result in any output.
import random

# Now you can write something like random.choice(["heads", "tails"])
# Like shorter names?
import random as rnd

# Now you can write something like rnd.choice(["heads", "tails"])
# Just want one function from a module?
from random import choice

# Now you can write: choice(["heads", "tails"])
# You can read more about modules at:

def greet(greeting):
    return greeting + ", World!"


# Now you can write greet("Hello")
# Note that strings can be designated using single or double quotes
def greet(greeting="Hello"):
    return greeting + ", World!"


# Now you can write greet() and it will begin with "Hello" by default
# because of the default argument named above
def greet(greeting="Hello", audience="World"):
    return f"{greeting}, {audience}!"


# f-strings are a syntactic convenience, and highly addictive.
# prefixing your string with f allows you to interpolate defined
# variables, denoted by curly braces
# Note the multiple defined arguments in the function. You can
# name your arguments when calling the function. For instance,
# you can write greet(audience="Galaxy")

# Python has many "types"
